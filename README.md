# data_driven_attribution_modeling
This repository contains the code for Data-Driven attribution modeling based on Shapley Value and Markov Chain

1. For Attribution Model based on Shapley Value, a custom code-based model is built to suit the need of input data format.
2. For Attribution Model based on Markov Chain, the available library _markov-model-attribution_ is used and results were analyzed for both the scenarios where 
  a. Only the user-journeys that led to conversions were considered for the final attribution result. 
  b. All the user-journeys from all Marketing Qualified Leads were considered for the final attribution result.
